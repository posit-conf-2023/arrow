    "text": "Larger-Than-Memory Data Option\n\n1. NYC Taxi Data\nThis is the main dataset we will need for the day. It’s pretty hefty—40 GB in total—and there are a couple of options for how to acquire it, depending on your internet connection speed.\n\nOption 1—the simplest option—for those with a good internet connection and happy to let things run\nIf you have a solid internet connection, and especially if you’re in the US/Canada, this option is the simplest. You can use arrow itself to download the data. Note that there are no progress bars displayed during download, and so your session will appear to hang, but you can check progress by inspecting the contents of the download directory. When we tested this with Steph’s laptop and a fast internet connection, it took 67 minutes, though results will likely vary widely.\nThis method requires the arrow R package to have been built with S3 support enabled. This is on by default for most MacOS and Windows users, but if you’re on Linux, take a look at the instructions here.\nAfter installing arrow, run the following code:\n\nlibrary(arrow)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\ndata_path &lt;- here::here(\"data/nyc-taxi\") # Or set your own preferred path\n\nopen_dataset(\"s3://voltrondata-labs-datasets/nyc-taxi\") |&gt;\n    filter(year %in% 2012:2021) |&gt; \n    write_dataset(data_path, partitioning = c(\"year\", \"month\"))\n\nOnce this has completed, you can check everything has downloaded correctly by calling:\n\nopen_dataset(data_path) |&gt;\n    nrow()\n\nIt might take a moment to run (the data has over a billion rows!), but you should expect to see:\n[1] 1150352666\nIf you get an error message, your download may have been interrupted at some point. The error message will name the file which could not be read. Manually delete this file and run the nrow() code snippet again until you successfully load the remaining data. You can then download any missing files individually using option 2.\n\n\nOption 2—one file at a time via https\nIf you have a slower internet connection or are further away from the data S3 bucket location, it’s probably going to be simpler to download the data file-by-file. Or, if you had any interruptions to your download process in the previous step, you can either try instead with this method, or delete the files which weren’t downloaded properly, and use this method to just download the files you need.\nWe’ve created a script for you which downloads the data one file at a time via https. The script also checks for previously downloaded data, so if you encounter problems downloading any files, just delete the partially downloaded file and run again—the script will only download files which are missing.\n\ndownload_via_https &lt;- function(data_dir, years = 2012:2021){\n\n    # Set this option as we'll be downloading large files and R has a default\n    # timeout of 60 seconds, so we've updated this to 30 mins\n    options(timeout = 1800)\n    \n    # The S3 bucket where the data is stored\n    bucket &lt;- \"https://voltrondata-labs-datasets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com\"\n    \n    # Collect any errors raised during the download process\n    problems &lt;- c()\n    \n    # Download the data from S3 - loops through the data files, downloading 1 file at a time\n    for (year in years) {\n      \n      # We only have 2 months for 2022 data\n      if(year ==2022){\n        months = 1:2\n      } else {\n        months = 1:12\n      }\n      \n      for (month in months) {\n        \n        # Work out where we're going to be saving the data\n        partition_dir &lt;- paste0(\"year=\", year, \"/month=\", month)\n        dest_dir &lt;- file.path(data_dir, partition_dir)\n        dest_file_path &lt;- file.path(dest_dir, \"part-0.parquet\")\n        \n        # If the file doesn't exist\n        if (!file.exists(dest_file_path)) {\n          \n          # Create the partition to store the data in\n          if(!dir.exists(dest_dir)){\n            dir.create(dest_dir, recursive = TRUE)\n          }\n           \n          # Work out where we are going to be retrieving the data from\n          source_path &lt;- file.path(bucket, \"nyc-taxi\", partition_dir, \"part-0.parquet\")\n          \n          # Download the data - save any error messages that occur\n          tryCatch(\n            download.file(source_path, dest_file_path, mode = \"wb\"),\n            error = function(e){\n              problems &lt;- c(problems, e$message)\n            }\n          )\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    \n    print(\"Downloads complete\")\n    \n    if(length(problems) &gt; 0){\n      warning(call. = FALSE, \"The following errors occurred during download:\\n\", paste(problems, collapse =  \"\\n\"))\n    }\n}\n\n\ndata_path &lt;- here::here(\"data/nyc-taxi\") # Or set your own preferred path\n\ndownload_via_https(data_path)\n\nOnce this has completed, you can check everything has downloaded correctly by calling:\n\nopen_dataset(data_path) |&gt;\n    nrow()\n\nIt might take a moment to run (the data has over a billion rows), but you should expect to see:\n[1] 1150352666\nIf you get an error message, your download may have been interrupted at some point. The error message will name the file which could not be read. Manually delete this file and run the nrow() code snippet again until you successfully load the data. You can then download any missing files by re-running download_via_https(data_path).\n\n\n\n2. Seattle Checkouts by Title Data\nThis is the data we will use to explore some data storage and engineering options. It’s a good sized, single CSV file—9GB on-disk in total, which can be downloaded from the an AWS S3 bucket via https:\n\noptions(timeout = 1800)\ndownload.file(\n  url = \"https://r4ds.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/seattle-library-checkouts.csv\",\n  destfile = here::here(\"data/seattle-library-checkouts.csv\")\n)"

    "text": "Tiny Data Option\nIf you don’t have time or disk space to download the larger-than-memory datasets (and still have disk space do the exercises), you can run the code and exercises in the course with “tiny” versions of these data. Although the focus in this course is working with larger-than-memory data, you can still learn about the concepts and workflows with smaller data—although note you may not see the same performance improvements that you would get when working with larger data.\n\n1. Tiny NYC Taxi Data\nWe’ve created a “tiny” NYC Taxi dataset which contains only 1 in 1000 rows from the original dataset. So instead of working with 1.15 billion rows of data and about 40GB of files, the tiny taxi dataset is 1.15 million rows and about 50MB of files. You can download the tiny NYC Taxi data directly from this repo via https:\n\noptions(timeout = 1800)\ndownload.file(\n  url = \"https://github.com/posit-conf-2023/arrow/releases/download/v0.1.0/nyc-taxi-tiny.zip\",\n  destfile = here::here(\"data/nyc-taxi-tiny.zip\")\n)\n\n# Extract the partitioned parquet files from the zip folder:\nunzip(\n  zipfile = here::here(\"data/nyc-taxi-tiny.zip\"), \n  exdir = here::here(\"data/\")\n)\n\n\n\n2. Tiny Seattle Checkouts by Title Data\nWe’ve created a “tiny” Seattle Checkouts by Title dataset which contains only 1 in 100 rows from the original dataset. So instead of working with ~41 million rows of data in a 9GB file, the tiny Seattle checkouts dataset is ~410 thousand rows and in an 90MB file. You can download the tiny Seattle Checkouts by Title data directly from this repo via https:\n\noptions(timeout = 1800)\ndownload.file(\n  url = \"https://github.com/posit-conf-2023/arrow/releases/download/v0.1.0/seattle-library-checkouts-tiny.csv\",\n  destfile = here::here(\"data/seattle-library-checkouts-tiny.csv\")\n)"

We will have 5 USB flash drives (and a few USB-C to USB adapters) on-hand the morning of the workshop with copies of all the larger-than-memory and tiny versions of the datasets. So if you have trouble downloading any of the data beforehand, we should be able to get you sorted before the day starts or as soon as possible as the day begins. And if disk space or laptop permissions are blockers, the workshop will have a dedicated Posit Cloud workspace ready for participants."

In this workshop you will learn how to use Apache Arrow, a multi-language toolbox for working with larger-than-memory tabular data, to create seamless “big” data analysis pipelines with R.\nThe workshop will focus on using the the arrow R package—a mature R interface to Apache Arrow—to process larger-than-memory files and multi-file datasets with arrow using familiar dplyr syntax. You’ll learn to create and use interoperable data file formats like Parquet for efficient data storage and access, with data stored both on disk and in the cloud, and also how to exercise fine control over data types to avoid common large data pipeline problems. This workshop will provide a foundation for using Arrow, giving you access to a powerful suite of tools for performant analysis of larger-than-memory data in R.\nThis course is for you if you:\n\nwant to learn how to work with tabular data that is too large to fit in memory using existing R and tidyverse syntax implemented in Arrow\nwant to learn about Parquet and other file formats that are powerful alternatives to CSV files\nwant to learn how to engineer your tabular data storage for more performant access and analysis with Apache Arrow\n\n\n\nWorkshop Prework\nDetailed instructions for software requirements and data sources are covered in Packages & Data.\nPlease try your very best to arrive on the workshop day ready with the required software & packages installed and the data downloaded on to your laptop.\n\n\nWorkshop Schedule\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime\nActivity\n\n\n\n\n09:00 - 10:30\nSession 1: Hello Arrow + Data Manipulation with Arrow I\n\n\n10:30 - 11:00\nCoffee break\n\n\n11:00 - 12:30\nSession 2: Data Engineering with Arrow\n\n\n12:30 - 13:30\nLunch break\n\n\n13:30 - 15:00\nSession 3: Data Manipulation with Arrow II\n\n\n15:00 - 15:30\nCoffee break\n\n\n15:30 - 17:00\nSession 4: Arrow In-Memory Workflows + Wrapping Up\n\n\n\n“This schedule is more what you would call a ‘guideline’ than an actual schedule” — Barbossa, Pirates of the Caribbean\n\n\nInstructors\nSteph Hazlitt is a data scientist, researcher and R enthusiast.
